    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    </p>
    <p>One fateful night off the coast of Great Britain in the year of our Lord 1966, the pirate radio ship, <em>Radio Reverb</em>, was being tossed about by a storm while broadcasting some seriously righteous jams when it was suddenly swallowed into a whirlpool and transported to the year 2018. The ship landed ashore and now lay in rubble. The crew all managed to survive and now found themselves in much chartered territory. <p>Once the crew began to understand this brave new world they realized their was no longer any use for pirate radio in 2019. The crew went their own separate ways. Some became lawyers, some baristas, one became vegan for a while. The remaining few decided to continue the dream of spreading the word about all the music that had happened since that fateful night. Needless to say, there has been a lot. They researched new avenues of media and met an aspiring web designer who built this website for them.</p><p><a class="home" href="file:///Users/Levi/Desktop/Web%20Development/Leaveittoreverb/leaveittoreverb.html">Here</a> you will find articles, musings, and poetic waxings of those few who couldn't bear to let the dream die. They made a pact to only write about what they really dig and don't talk about what they don't dig. So please enjoy and if you're interested in getting in touch with our webmaster please do not hesitate for a second to contact him.</p>
